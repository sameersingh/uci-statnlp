    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST) is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context—i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, given a sequence of words $\\mathbf{x} = \\left< x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_t \\right>$ the goal is to learn a model $P(y_i \\,|\\, \\mathbf{x})$ where $y_i$ is the POS tag associated with the $x_i$.\n",
    "Note that the model is conditioned on all of $\\mathbf{x}$ not just the words that occur earlier in the sentence - this is because we can assume that the entire sentence is known at the time of tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",

    "We will train our model on the [Engligh Dependencies Treebank](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English).\n",

    "The main upshot of using the `Dataset` class is that it makes accessing training/test observations very simple. Accordingly, this makes batch generation easy since all we need to do is randomly choose numbers and then grab those observations from the dataset - PyTorch includes a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` object which handles this for you. In fact, if we were not working with sequential data we would be able to proceed straight to the modeling step from here. However, since we are working with sequential data there is one last pesky issue we need to handle - padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that when we are given a batch of outputs from `CoNLLDataset`, the sequences in the batch are likely to all be of different length. To deal with this, we define a custom `collate_annotations` function which adds padding to the end of the sequences in the batch so that they are all the same length. In addition, we'll have this function take care of loading the data into tensors and ensuring that the tensor dimensions are in the order expected by PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh and one last annoying thing - to deal with some of the issues caused by using padded data we will be using a function called `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequences` in our model later on. All you need to know now is that this function expects our sequences in the batch to be sorted in terms of descending length, and that we know the lengths of each sequence. So we will make sure that the `collate_annotations` function performs this sorting for us and returns the sequence lengths in addition to the input and target tensors."

    "The model implementation is relatively simple, we will use the following architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embed the input words into a 200 dimensional vector space.\n",
    "2. Feed the word embeddings into a (bidirectional) GRU.\n",
    "3. Feed the GRU outputs into a fully connected layer.\n",
    "4. Use a softmax activation to get the probabilities of the different labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only complication arises during the forward computation. As was noted in the dataset section, the input sequences are padded. This causes an issue since we do not want to waste computational resources feeding these pad tokens into the RNN. In PyTorch, we can deal with this issue by converting the data into a  `torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence` object and letting PyTorch take care of it."
